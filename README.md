### Ruby applications architecture for simplicity and team adoption

Architecture is hard. Itâ€™s very easy to build a complex system; much harder to build a simple and adaptable one. The code doesn't matter and coding for the sake of writing code is foolish.

Few of us get to write software that survives 5-10 years or longer. 90% of our work is garbage that becomes obsolete 1-3 years after release. Most of our work hours are wasted on features that never get shipped.

This is just reality.

# AXR

**Ruby architecture for simplicity and team adoption**

Architecture is hard. Itâ€™s very easy to build a complex system; much harder to build a simple and adaptable one. The code doesn't matter and coding for the sake of writing code is foolish.

Few of us get to write software that survives 5-10 years or longer. 90% of our work is garbage that becomes obsolete 1-3 years after release. Most of our work hours are wasted on features that never get shipped.

This is just reality.

## Setup

```sh
gem install axr
```

or in your Gemfile
```ruby
gem 'axr'
```

in console
```sh
bundle install
```

## DSL

In your ruby app: (for rails app put it into `config/initializers`)
```ruby
require 'axr'

AxR.app.define do
  layer 'Api'
  layer 'YourBusinessLogic'
  layer 'Repo'
end
```

By default, layers will get level from top to bottom.
```
Api -> 0
YourBusinessLogic -> 1
Repo -> 2
```

Layers with lower-level have less isolation.

- `Api` knows about `YourBusinessLogic` and `Repo`
- `YourBusinessLogic` knows about `Repo` but don't know anything about `Api`
- `Repo` fully isolated and don't familiar with `Api` and `YourBusinessLogic`

**Options**

```ruby
require 'axr'

AxR.app.define do
  layer 'A'
  layer 'B', familiar_with: 'C'
  layer 'C', familiar_with: 'B'
  layer 'D', isolated: true
  layer 'E', isolated: true
end
```

```ruby

# app.define options
AxR.app.define(isolated: true) # All layers will be isolated by default
AxR.app.define(familiar_with: ['D', 'E') # All layers will be familiar with D and E by default

# layer options
familiar_with: [...] # Can operate with other layers
isolated: true # 100% isolated and should not operate with other layers
isolated: true, familiar_with: [...] # Isolated from all except familiars
```

Can organize knowledge structure like:

## CLI

Run `AxR` checker in console
```sh
axr check . --load path/to/you/app/autoload.rb
```

For rails apps
```sh
axr check . --load config/environment
```

Run for a specific directory
```sh
axr lib/adapters
```

Run for a specific file
```sh
axr lib/adapters/youtube.rb
```

## More examples

**ERP system**

<img src="docs/images/erp_example.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

```ruby
require 'axr'

AxR.app.define(isolated: true) do
  layer 'Api',    familiar_with: ['ERP']
  layer 'UI',     familiar_with: ['ERP']
  layer 'ERP',    familiar_with: %w[Inventory Sales Supply]
  layer 'Sales',  familiar_with: 'Inventory'
  layer 'Supply', familiar_with: 'Inventory'
  layer 'Repo'
  layer 'Change'
  layer 'Query'
end
```

### TODO
- Add sublayers
- Add `axr check --exit-on-warning` cli flag
